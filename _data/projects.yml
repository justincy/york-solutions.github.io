    The website runs on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    and is hosted in the [Amazon cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/).
    We maintained the open source libraries [fs-traversal](https://github.com/genealogysystems/fs-traversal)
    and [fs-check](https://github.com/genealogysystems/fs-check)
    and made significant contributions to the [FamilySearch JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/rootsdev/familysearch-javascript-sdk).

    After The Beast had an existing design which we were asked to implement as 
    a static site with a little JavaScript. We worked closely with the designer to
    make all fonts, sizes, and spacing match exactly as they wanted it.

    We updated the existing site hosted on Weebly. We were asked to move 
    navigation from the top  to the left and make the content 
    fill the remaining width of the page. We also helped enhance their
    [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).

    We moved an existing website built on Django to one hosted on 
    [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/). Shopify offered hosting that
    we didn't have to manage, a store and payment system which supported BitCoin
    as a payment method (a requirement of the project), and the ability to add
    custom pages to the website.
