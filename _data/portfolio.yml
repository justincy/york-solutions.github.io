    [FamilySearch](https://familysearch.org) asked us to enhance both their
    [PHP](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-php) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/FamilySearch/familysearch-javascript-sdk) SDKs.
    That included adding new features, simplyfing the interface, enhancing documentation,
    developing sample apps, and creating a [utility](https://github.com/FamilySearch/sandbox-data-copy)
    for loading data into their sandbox environment. We also began work on
    [their collection](https://github.com/fs-webcomponents) of 
    [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) based [web components](http://webcomponents.org/).

    links to persons in the FamilySearch tree. We also developed
    an interactive pedigree view using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and upgraded
    their JavaScript SDK.

    and made significant contributions to the [FamilySearch JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/rootsdev/familysearch-javascript-sdk).

#     [After The Beast](http://afterthebeast.com) had an existing design which we were asked to implement as 
#     a static site with a little JavaScript. We worked closely with the designer to
#     make all fonts, sizes, and spacing match exactly as they wanted it.

#     [Arastan Photography](http://www.arastanphotography.com/) wanted an existing website hosted
#     on Weebly to be enhanced. We were asked to move 
#     navigation from the top to the left and make the content 
#     fill the remaining width of the page. We also consulted on enhancing their SEO.

#    We moved an existing website built on Django to one hosted on 
#    [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/). Shopify offered hosting that
#    we didn't have to manage, a store and payment system which supported BitCoin
#    as a payment method (a requirement of the project), and the ability to add
#    custom pages to the website.
