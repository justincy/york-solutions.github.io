I decided to start create a company website and blog. I thought it would be easy. 
I've started many other blogs in the past. [^1] Though this time my requirements 
would be a little bit different.

1. Free, unless it's _really_ good
2. Hosted
3. Write posts in markdown
4. Syntax highlighting for code blocks

## Blogger

In the past I have used [Blogger](http://blogger.com). It's free and very
easy to setup. But Blogger's editor doesn't mix well with code blocks. I would
have to edit posts in HTML mode. And if I happened to switch into the non-HTML
mode I would run the risk of Blogger messing up my formatting. Plus to get syntax
highlighting I would have to embark on a scary process whose instructions always
begin with "make a backup."

## WordPress

The WordPress community is excellent and you can make WordPress do anything.
But I don't need everything, nor do I want to worry about hosting it myself
or paying for hosting to get a simple blog with a few static pages.

## Ghost

I looked at [Ghost](https://ghost.org) which is beautiful. And it's open-source.
You have the choice of downloading the code and hosting yourself for "free"
(still have to pay for your own hosting costs) or you can pay them to hose it
for you. Ghost was compelling enough that I was willing to pay if it worked out
and they had a free trial so I signed up. That was the end of our happy
relationship.

Right after registering with Ghost, I created my site then had to create
_another_ account which was specific to my site and different than my Ghost
account.

Syntax highlighting is also not supported out of the box. I could add it by modifying
the theme myself. But then I couldn't find a built in theme editor which leads
to a clunky process: modify the theme, zip, upload, test, repeat.

## GitHub

Did you know GitHub was a blogging platform? [^2] I have vague memories of this
being a big thing a few years ago. The fad has fizzled but 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is alive and well. Jekyll? Ruby?
Would it be worth it? It met all of my requirements so I gave it a shot.
